First project in JavaScript!!

The code is an elementary virtual representation of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. It consists of 4 functions (computerPlay(), playRound(), game() and shakeAndDraw()) which can be triggered by three buttons in the DOM, each containing one option to choose from.

At the end of this project, the noob will be able to create functions, structure conditionals and bind them to a DOM representation.

This is the continuation of the first project from the "The Odin Project"'s JS module of Web Development 101.

From Jes√∫s's creativity (https://github.com/jevazquezb/rock-paper-scissors.git)
