First project in JavaScript!!

The code is an elementary virtual representation of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. It consists of 3 functions (computerPlay(), playRound() and game()) and you can play it from the browser's console by typing "game()".

At the end of this project, the noob will be able to create functions and to structure conditionals.

This is the first project for the JS module of Web Development 101 from "The Odin Project".

From Jes√∫s's creativity (https://github.com/jevazquezb/rock-paper-scissors.git)
